## Stream processing with RisingWave

In this hands-on workshop, we‚Äôll learn how to process real-time streaming data using SQL in RisingWave. The system we‚Äôll use is [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave), an open-source SQL database for processing and managing streaming data. You may not feel unfamiliar with RisingWave‚Äôs user experience, as it‚Äôs fully wire compatible with PostgreSQL.

![RisingWave](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-docs/main/docs/images/new_archi_grey.png)



We‚Äôll cover the following topics in this Workshop: 

- Why Stream Processing?
- Stateless computation (Filters, Projections)
- Stateful Computation (Aggregations, Joins)
- Data Ingestion and Delivery

## Homework

**Please setup the environment in [Getting Started](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-data-talks-workshop-2024-03-04?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) and for the [Homework](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave-data-talks-workshop-2024-03-04/blob/main/homework.md#setting-up) first.**


## Question 0

_This question is just a warm-up to introduce dynamic filter, please attempt it before viewing its solution._

What are the dropoff taxi zones at the latest dropoff times?

For this part, we will use the [dynamic filter pattern](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/sql-pattern-dynamic-filters/).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW latest_dropoff_time AS
    WITH t AS (
        SELECT MAX(tpep_dropoff_datetime) AS latest_dropoff_time
        FROM trip_data
    )
    SELECT taxi_zone.Zone as taxi_zone, latest_dropoff_time
    FROM t,
            trip_data
    JOIN taxi_zone
        ON trip_data.DOLocationID = taxi_zone.location_id
    WHERE trip_data.tpep_dropoff_datetime = t.latest_dropoff_time;

--    taxi_zone    | latest_dropoff_time
-- ----------------+---------------------
--  Midtown Center | 2022-01-03 17:24:54
-- (1 row)
```

### Question 1

Create a materialized view to compute the average, min and max trip time between each taxi zone.

From this MV, find the pair of taxi zones with the highest average trip time.
You may need to use the [dynamic filter pattern](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/sql-pattern-dynamic-filters/) for this.

Bonus (no marks): Create an MV which can identify anomalies in the data. For example, if the average trip time between two zones is 1 minute,
but the max trip time is 10 minutes and 20 minutes respectively.

Options:
1. Yorkville East, Steinway
2. Murray Hill, Midwood
3. East Flatbush/Farragut, East Harlem North
4. Midtown Center, University Heights/Morris Heights

### Question 2

Recreate the MV(s) in question 1, to also find the number of trips for the pair of taxi zones with the highest average trip time.

Options:
1. 5
2. 3
3. 10
4. 1

### Question 3

From the latest pickup time to 17 hours before, what are the top 3 busiest zones in terms of number of pickups?
For example if the latest pickup time is 2020-01-01 12:00:00,
then the query should return the top 3 busiest zones from 2020-01-01 11:00:00 to 2020-01-01 12:00:00.

HINT: You can use [dynamic filter pattern](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/sql-pattern-dynamic-filters/)
to create a filter condition based on the latest pickup time.

NOTE: For this question `17 hours` was picked to ensure we have enough data to work with.

Options:
1. Clinton East, Upper East Side North, Penn Station
2. LaGuardia Airport, Lincoln Square East, JFK Airport
3. Midtown Center, Upper East Side South, Upper East Side North
4. LaGuardia Airport, Midtown Center, Upper East Side North
